// This Genkit AI flow has been removed.
// This logic is the core of the candidate ranking and would be implemented
// in your Python backend. It would involve:
// 1. Parsing resume files (PDFs, etc.).
// 2. Calling an LLM with the resume text and the job description.
// 3. Prompting the LLM to extract details, score the candidate, and generate a summary.
// 4. Returning the structured data as a JSON response from your Python API.
