// This file's contents have been removed.
// In a Python-backend architecture, the logic that was here (e.g., creating jobs,
// ranking candidates, sending emails) would be implemented in your Python
// application and exposed via API endpoints (e.g., /api/jobs, /api/candidates).

// The frontend component (src/app/page.tsx) would be updated to make HTTP
// requests (fetch) to these Python endpoints instead of calling functions from this file.
